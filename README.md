# Graph convolutional networks

## Overview

This repo was forked from bknyaz to test the possibility to use GCN with contrastive loss for graph mathing. New jupyter demo notebook was added along with a modified dataloader to handle a scenario, where a pair of graphs should have close embeddings.  NT-Xent loss was used to train the global graph embeddings.
I use graphs extracted from geo spatial data and try to match them across time.
